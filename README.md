Word-count-not-working
======================

Recently i have downloaded ckeditor(ckeditor_4.4.3_basic)  , have deployed countword(1.10) plugin and have configured the config page  config.extraPlugins = 'wordcount'; config.wordcount = {  // Whether or not you want to show the Word Count showWordCount: true,  // Whether or not you want to show the Char Count showCharCount: true }; In footer of ckeditor words:0 is showing but when i write anything in the editor the words number stills at 0. I mean it is not counting. Any help is welcomed warmly. Thanks is advance.
